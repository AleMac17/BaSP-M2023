###### Week 00
*Very Excited about the course*

## Week 01
In the first week, we created the design of the website in Figma. On this page, you will be able to see in detail all that the gym can offer, as well as a brief introduction and a little about our history

## Week 02
In the second week, we created the HTML for the page, making sure to use all the best practices, both in semantic tags and in content distribution. We used Git to save and manage the different updates, and then used GitHub to share the project

## Week 03
In the third week, using basic CSS, we styled our HTML to practice and solidify our knowledge in designing and laying out a web page. We learned how to use colors, backgrounds, and basic positioning, as well as how to link our HTML with a CSS file.
