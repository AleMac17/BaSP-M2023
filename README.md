# Become a Software Professional 2023

###### Week 00
*Very Excited about the course*

## Week 01
In the first week, we created the design of the website in Figma. On this page, you will be able to see in detail all that the gym can offer, as well as a brief introduction and a little about our history

## Week 02
In the second week, we created the HTML for the page, making sure to use all the best practices, both in semantic tags and in content distribution. We used Git to save and manage the different updates, and then used GitHub to share the project

## Week 03
In the third week, using basic CSS, we styled our HTML to practice and solidify our knowledge in designing and laying out a web page. We learned how to use colors, backgrounds, and basic positioning, as well as how to link our HTML with a CSS file.

## Week 04
In this week, I used Flexbox to create a flexible and adaptable layout. This allowed me to easily organize the elements of the page in rows or columns, adjust their size and alignment effortlessly, and change their order if needed. With Flexbox, I achieved a responsive design that automatically adapts to different screen sizes and devices, without complications or complex layout structures. It was an effective tool for creating a modern and efficient design on my web page.

## Week 05
I completed a JavaScript practice in which I worked with a variety of concepts, including the use of variables, strings, arrays, if-else statements, for loops, and functions. I used variables to store values and perform operations with them, strings to manipulate text, and arrays to organize data into lists. I also employed if-else statements to make decisions based on specific conditions, and for loops to iterate over arrays or perform repetitive tasks. Additionally, I implemented functions to encapsulate reusable and modular code, which allowed me to learn how to optimize and organize my code efficiently. It was a valuable practice that familiarized me with these essential JavaScript concepts and enabled me to apply them in creating functional and dynamic programs.
